  description: 'Gets information about the latest version for every traffic policy
    that is associatedwith the current AWS account. Send a GET request to the /Amazon
    Route 53API version/trafficpolicy resource.Amazon Route 53 returns a maximum of
    100 items in each response. If you have a lot of trafficpolicies, you can use
    the maxitems parameter to list them in groups of up to100.The response includes
    three values that help you navigate from one group ofmaxitems traffic policies
    to the next:             IsTruncated           If the value of IsTruncated in
    the response is true,there are more traffic policies associated with the current
    AWS account.If IsTruncated is false, this response includes the lasttraffic policy
    that is associated with the current account.             TrafficPolicyIdMarker           If
    IsTruncated is true,TrafficPolicyIdMarker is the ID of the first traffic policy
    in the nextgroup of MaxItems traffic policies. If you want to list more trafficpolicies,
    make another call to ListTrafficPolicies, and specify the value ofthe TrafficPolicyIdMarker
    element from the response in theTrafficPolicyIdMarker request parameter.If IsTruncated
    is false, theTrafficPolicyIdMarker element is omitted from the response.             MaxItems           The
    value that you specified for the MaxItems parameter in the requestthat produced

        theCreateHealthCheckResponse element, containing the health check ID specifiedwhen
        adding health check to a resource record set. For information about adding
        health checksto resource record sets, see ResourceRecordSet:HealthCheckId
        in ChangeResourceRecordSets. If you are registering EC2 instances with an
        Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) loadbalancer, do not create Amazon Route 53 health
        checks for the EC2 instances. When you register anEC2 instance with a load
        balancer, you configure settings for an ELB health check, whichperforms a
        similar function to an Amazon Route 53 health check.You can associate health
        checks with failover resource record sets in a private hostedzone. Note the
        following:Amazon Route 53 health checkers are outside the VPC. To check the
        health of an endpointwithin a VPC by IP address, you must assign a public
        IP address to the instance in theVPC.You can configure a health checker to
        check the health of an external resource thatthe instance relies on, such
        as a database server.You can create a CloudWatch metric, associate an alarm
        with the metric, and then create ahealth check that is based on the state
        of the alarm. For example, you might create a CloudWatchmetric that checks
        the status of the Amazon EC2 StatusCheckFailed metric, add analarm to the
        metric, and then create a health check that is based on the state of thealarm.
        For information about creating CloudWatch metrics and alarms by using the
        CloudWatch console,see the Amazon CloudWatch User Guide.

        Route 53 hosted ZoneID/rrset resource. The request body must include a document
        with aChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest element. The request body contains a
        list ofchange items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered
        transactional changes.When using the Amazon Route 53 API to change resource
        record sets, Amazon Route 53 either makes all or none of thechanges in a change
        batch request. This ensures that Amazon Route 53 never partially implements
        theintended changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone. For example,
        a change batch request that deletes the CNAME record forwww.example.com and
        creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. Amazon Route 53
        deletesthe first resource record set and creates the second resource record
        set in a singleoperation. If either the DELETE or the CREATE action fails,
        thenboth changes (plus any other changes in the batch) fail, and the original
        CNAMErecord continues to exist.ImportantDue to the nature of transactional
        changes, you can''t delete the same resourcerecord set more than once in a
        single change batch. If you attempt to delete the same changebatch more than
        once, Amazon Route 53 returns an InvalidChangeBatch error.NoteTo create resource
        record sets for complex routing configurations, use either thetraffic flow
        visual editor in the Amazon Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic
        policies andtraffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a traffic
        policy, then associate thetraffic policy with one or more domain names (such
        as example.com) or subdomain names (suchas www.example.com), in the same hosted
        zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll backthe updates if the new
        configuration isn''t performing as expected. For more information, seeUsing
        Traffic Flow to Route DNSTraffic in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.Use
        ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest to perform the following actions:                  CREATE:
        Creates a resource record set that has the specified values.                  DELETE:
        Deletes an existing resource record set that has the specified values.                  UPSERT:
        If a resource record set does not already exist, AWS createsit. If a resource
        set does exist, Amazon Route 53 updates it with the values in the request.
        The values that you need to include in the request depend on the type of resource
        record set that you''re creating, deleting, or updating:            Basic
        resource record sets (excluding alias, failover, geolocation, latency, and
        weighted resource record sets)                           Name                                 Type                                 TTL                           Failover,

        (for failover, geolocation, latency, and weighted resource record sets)When
        you submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, Amazon Route 53 propagates
        your changes to all of the Amazon Route 53 authoritative DNS servers. While
        your changes are propagating, GetChange returns a status of PENDING. When
        propagation is complete, GetChange returns a status of INSYNC. Changes generally
        propagate to all Amazon Route 53 name servers in a few minutes. In rare circumstances,
        propagation can take up to 30 minutes. For more information, see GetChange       For
